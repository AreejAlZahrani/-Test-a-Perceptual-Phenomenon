Remember to follow [the instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-OkpZLjG_kX9J6LIQ5IltsqMzVWjh36QpnP2RYpVdPU/pub?embedded=True) and review the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/71/view) before submitting. Once you've completed the analysis and write-up, download this file as a PDF or HTML file, upload that PDF/HTML into the workspace here (click on the orange Jupyter icon in the upper left then Upload), then use the Submit Project button at the bottom of this page. This will create a zip file containing both this .ipynb doc and the PDF/HTML doc that will be submitted for your project.\n",
